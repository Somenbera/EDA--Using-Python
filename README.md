I recently conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset named 'swiggy.csv', which contains comprehensive restaurant information. I started by loading the data into a Python environment and spent some time understanding its structure and contents. I meticulously checked for any missing values across the dataset and handled them appropriately to ensure data integrity. I then proceeded to summarize the statistics of the numerical columns, gaining valuable insights into the distribution and central tendencies of features like prices, ratings, and delivery times.

To further explore the relationships between the numerical features, I utilized visualizations such as a correlation heatmap. This allowed me to identify any significant correlations between variables like restaurant ratings and prices, or delivery times and food types. The dataset includes a wealth of details, including restaurant IDs, areas, cities, food types, and more, which I leveraged to uncover meaningful patterns and insights. Overall, this analysis provided a solid foundation for understanding the dataset's structure and the relationships between its various variables.
